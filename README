HW 2
Comp 15
To complie: "make cheshire"
To run: "./cheshire"
Acknowledgments: The lecture slides on copy constructors and assignment
constructors, and my friend Tyler for listening to me complain. Also, I reused
many concepts from HW1 in terms of the errors and Lab 2 in terms of Doubly-Linked Lists.
Purpose: To create linked lists that holds elements.
Files submitted:
- README: this file
- Makefile
- testLinkedList.cpp: Driver file which uses their functions
- LinkedList.cpp: Holds each CharArrayList function
- LinkedList.h: defines CharArrayList class and the scope of each function
Testing:
I began by creating the header file and defining the first constructor,
which I then created an instance of. After that compiled, I added a print
function, and then created and tested the other  two constructors.
I then tested various functions on each test list. For the first list,
I tested both push/pop functions, first, last, and clear.
I used the second list to test the concatenate, remove and replace functions.
Finally, I  used the last instance to check the insert in order and
find functions. Once all of these were functional using char as E,
I switched everything to templetes and tested using ints as E.
Structures:
DoublyLinkedList, a structure which allows for adding/removing elements by 
setting pointers to other objects which are defined as being before and after
it.
Notes:
Elements are compared using <= and they must be printable.
